Is it still possible to develop a multiplatform videogame from scratch in 2025?\
Meaning with no pre-made engines and the least amount of dependencies?\
Sadly [less and less devs](https://80.lv/articles/less-than-10-of-games-released-on-steam-in-2024-were-made-with-proprierary-engines/) are doing it and this is choking technological innovation,
making it a privilege reserved for very few top studios and specialized companies.\
According to [this article](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/why-and-how-you-should-leave-unity-and-unreal-to-make-your-own-engine) it can even be a good idea.\
And have a look at Animal Well and Tiny Glade: they did it and it worked very well for them!
